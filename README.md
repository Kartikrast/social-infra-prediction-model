## 📝 Project Overview

**Type:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Contribution:** Individual  
**Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Kartikrast/social-infra-prediction-model)

This project explores and predicts key aspects of school infrastructure using real-world data from schools in the Samarkand region. The model aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers, planners, and the education sector, focusing on improving learning environments and supporting data-driven decisions for future investments.

## 📊 Data Insights

- **Data Source:** School infrastructure dataset (Samarkand region)
- **Key Features:** School name, location, capacity, building age, amenities, safety metrics, utilities, satisfaction scores, etc.
- **First Glimpse:**
  - 50+ features covering physical, operational, and environmental aspects of schools.
  - Cleaned, structured, and visualized for maximum insight.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights

- **Univariate Analysis:**  
  - Examined distributions of construction years, capacities, and infrastructure conditions.
  - Identified age and condition hotspots for targeted improvements.

- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:**  
  - Correlated school capacity with number of operational shifts.
  - Explored links between utilities (electricity, water) and student satisfaction.
  - Used heatmaps and pairplots to uncover hidden trends.

- **Visualizations:**  
  - Over 15 meaningful charts: histograms, boxplots, bar charts, correlation matrices, and more.
  - Each chart accompanied by business insight and actionable recommendation.

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling

- **Techniques:** Regression and classification to predict facility needs and satisfaction.
- **Evaluation:** Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for robust results.
- **Impact:** Models highlight infrastructure factors most critical to student outcomes.

---

## 💡 Key Insights & Impact

- **Aging Infrastructure:** Many schools need urgent renovation for safety and compliance.
- **Capacity Constraints:** Overcrowded schools run multiple shifts, affecting learning quality.
- **Resource Gaps:** Gaps in utilities and sports facilities impact student satisfaction.

## 🔮 Future Opportunities: LLMs & GPT for Human Interaction

- **Natural Language Search:** Enable stakeholders to query infrastructure data conversationally (e.g., “Show schools needing roof repairs built before 2000”).
- **Automated Reporting:** Use LLMs to generate regular, plain-language summaries and policy briefs from the latest data.
- **Interactive Chatbots:** Deploy AI assistants for data exploration and instant answers to infrastructure queries.
- **Feedback Integration:** Collect and analyze stakeholder feedback using LLMs for continuous improvement.

---

## 🚦 Next Steps

- Integrate LLM-powered dashboards for smarter, faster data retrieval.
- Expand predictive models to other regions and infrastructure domains.
- Collaborate with policymakers for pilot interventions in identified schools.

## 🌟 Conclusion

This project is a step toward data-driven, equitable, and sustainable school infrastructure planning. By combining EDA, predictive modeling, and AI-powered interaction, it seeks to bridge the gap between raw data and real-world impact.
